## Hi there 👋 I'm EvanDavies1.

- 💬 About me: I am a Computer Science Student who loves problem solving.
- 🌱 What I am doing: I am currently in my first year of a Computer Science course. I am currently doing multiple modules including programming, Information and Security, and Professionalism and employability.
- ⚡ Skillset: I am currently learning C++ and SQL.
- 🔭 Recent Projects Completed: I have completed multiple projects as part of my programming module. These being:\
  **Monthly Income** - I wrote a program that combines basic pay, medical allowance and bonus pay, to show the total monthly income, with medical allowance and bonus pay being percentages.\
  **Height in Meters** - I wrote a program that requires the user to input their height in feet and inches, where it would then be converted in to meters.\
  **Annual High Temperatures** - I wrote a program where the average temperatures of three US States were increased by 15%.\
  **Burger Stall** - I wrote a program where a burger stall sells four diffrent burgers, each with different prices. The user was required to input how many of each burger was sold, where the program would then calculate the total sales for that day.\
  **Project Hours** - I wrote a program where Bob works 4 hours and 30 minutes each day on a project, while jenny works 3 days and 15 mniutes each day on the same project. The user would then input how many days each of them worked on the project and the program would calculate the total amount of time spent on the project in hours and minutes.\
  **House Budget** - I wrote a program where the user has to input their monthly costs for rent/mortgage, internet, gas, electricity and water. The program would then display their monthly costs alongside their yearly costs for each of these expenses.\
  **Coin Toss** - I wrote a program that simulated a coin toss. The user would have to input their guess, either heads or tails, and if they won, the program would display 'You Win', while if they lost, the program would display 'You Lose'.\
  **Area of Triangle** - I wrote a program where the user would have to input the length of all three sides of a triangle. The program would then use that data to calculate the area of the triangle.\
  **Rainfall** - I wrote a program that reads in from a file contaning the monthly rainfall of four diffrent months, where the program would then calculate the total rainfall over that four-month period.\
  **Distance Travelled** - I wrote a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle in mph, and for how many hours the vehicle was travelling. The program would then calculate the distance travelled and display the distance travelled for each hour.\
- 😄 Hobbies: I enjoy playing video games and going out with friends. I also play the guitar and sometimes volunteer at a local charity shop when I have time.
